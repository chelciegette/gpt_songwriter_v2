Time Signature: 4/4

[Intro]
Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D (x4)

[Verse 1]
Gmaj
No I'm not color blind
Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D
I know the world is black and white
Gmaj
Try to keep an open mind
Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D
I just can't sleep on this tonight

[Chorus]
Gmmaj7
Stop this train, I want to get off and go home again
D/F#
I can't take the speed it's moving in
E9
I know I can't
Gsus2/A – A7 – Am7 – A9
But honestly, won't someone stop this train
(Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D) x2

Notes:
- Gmmaj7 and D/F# establish minor modal contrast and descending bassline
- A7 → Am7 → A9 softens the cadence while maintaining motion
- Harmonic rhythm mirrors lyrical anxiety

[Verse 2]
Gmaj
Don't know how else to say it
Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D
Don't want to see my parents go
Gmaj
One generation's length away
Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D
From fighting life out on my own

[Repeat Chorus]

[Interlude]
Gmaj
(Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D) x2

[Verse 3]
Gmaj
So scared of getting older
Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D
I'm only good at being young
Gmaj
So I play the numbers game
Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D
To say that life has just begun
Gmaj
Had a talk with my old man
Gm7
Said help me understand
D/F#
He said turn 68
E7
You'll renegotiate

[Chorus]
Gmmaj7
Don't stop this train
D/F#
Don't for a minute change the place you're in
E9
Don't think I couldn't understand
Gsus2/A – A7 – Am7 – A9
John, honestly we'll never stop this train
(Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D) x2

[Bridge]
G – A11 – G/B
Once in a while when it's good
Em13/C# – G
It'll feel like it should
A11 – G/B
And they're all still around
Em13/C# – G
And you're still safe and sound
A11 – G/B
You don't miss a thing
Em13/C# – Dadd4 – Am9 – Em9
'Til you cry when you're driving away in the dark

[Final Chorus]
Gmmaj7
Stop this train, I want to get off and go home again
D/F#
I can't take this speed it's moving in
E9
I know I can't
Gsus2/A – A7 – Am7 – A9
Cause now I see I'll never stop this train
Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D

[Outro]
Dsus2 – Dmaj13 – Bm9/D – Asus2/D
