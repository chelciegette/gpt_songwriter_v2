Title: If I Ain’t Got You
Artist: Alicia Keys
Genre: Soul / R&B Ballad
Key: C Major (transposed live/performances may vary)
Tempo: Slow ballad, ~64 BPM
Time Signature: 6/8

[Intro]
Cmaj7 – Bm7 – Am7 – Gmaj7 – Am7 – Bm7
Cmaj7 – Bm7 – Bbm7 – Am7 – Gmaj7

Notes:
- Chromatic descending motion through Bm7 → Bbm7 → Am7 creates emotional gravity
- Cmaj7 and Gmaj7 establish tonal warmth
- Repetition emphasizes longing and lyrical intimacy

[Verse 1]
Abmaj7 – Gmaj7 – Em7
Am7 – D9
Abmaj7 – Gmaj7 – G#dim7
Am7 – D9

Notes:
- Abmaj7 → Gmaj7 introduces non-diatonic color (borrowed chords with descending motion)
- Use of G#dim7 as chromatic passing chord between Gmaj7 and Am7
- D9 sets up return to Gmaj7 (secondary dominant movement)

[Pre-Chorus]
Gmaj7 – Am7 – Bm7 – Am7
Gmaj7 – Am7 – Bm7 – Cmaj7
Bm7 – Am7 – Gmaj7 – Am7
Bm7 – Am7 – Gmaj7 – Am7 – Bm7

Notes:
- Voice-leading between Bm7 and Am7 keeps harmonic motion smooth and expressive
- Cmaj7 adds lift at midpoint; ends with unresolved progression into chorus
- Strong soul ballad flavor with extended and minor 7ths throughout

[Chorus]
Cmaj9 – Bm7 – Am7 – Gmaj7
Gmaj7 – Am7 – Bm7 – Cmaj7
Bm7 – Bbm7 – Am7 – Gmaj7
Gmaj7 – Gmaj7 – Gmaj7

Notes:
- Cmaj9 brings lushness to opening of chorus
- Bbm7 borrowed from parallel minor creates emotional twist before resolving back to Gmaj7
- Repeated Gmaj7 in final phrase acts as emotional anchor

[Verse 2]
(Same as Verse 1)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Same as earlier pre-chorus)

[Chorus]
(Same structure, repeated with lyrical and harmonic embellishments)

[Outro]
Cmaj7 – Bm7 – Am7 – Gmaj7
Am7 – Bm7 – Cmaj7 – Bm7
Bbm7 – Am7 – Gmaj7 – D

Ending Notes:
- Final line ends on D, creating an upward harmonic push (dominant gesture)
- B chromatic scale up an octave with G bass note = musical punctuation for outro
- Last vocal line stretches high in range, increasing intensity
