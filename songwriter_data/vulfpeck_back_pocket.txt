Title: Back Pocket
Artist: Vulfpeck
Genre: Funk / Soul / Retro Pop
Key: G Major (modal shifts and borrowed chords throughout)
Tempo: Mid-tempo groove, ~90 BPM
Time Signature: 4/4

[Intro]
G – C/G

[Refrain]
G
I know
Am – Bbm
That it's taken me all this time to say girl
Bm
I'm slow
Am – D7
So it's taken me all this time to say girl
G
Tip toe
Am – Bbm
And I want to acknowledge my mistake girl
Bm
Uh oh
Am – D7
And I hope that you know it's not too late

Notes:
- G major tonal center, with frequent use of chromatic movement (Am → Bbm → Bm)
- Bbm is borrowed from G minor; adds nostalgic, jazzy color
- D7 resolves back to tonic G major as V7

[Hook]
Bm/D
Put it in my pocket
Am/E
In my back pocket
Bm/D
In my pocket
Am/C
Oh oh oh

Bm/D
Put it in my pocket
Am/E
In my back pocket
Bm/D – Am/C – Bm/D – Am/E – D7/F#

Notes:
- Bass-driven slash chords emphasize groove and low-end movement
- Bm/D anchors the harmonic rhythm
- D7/F# pulls back to G major but delays resolution with suspensions

[Verse]
G
Do you like me? Circle yes or no
Am – Bbm – Bm
'Cause I really really need to know
Am – D7
Are you gonna be my fifth grade queen?
G
Hand it back after second hour
Am – Bbm – Bm
I will know if you're my special flower
Am – D7

Notes:
- Chord motion between Am → Bbm → Bm is repeated, driving both lyric and harmony forward
- D7 remains a consistent resolution tool, maintaining song’s cyclical feel

[Bridge]
Cmaj7 – Bm7/D
When you kissed me on the playground
D#dim
I lost my breath
Em – Em/G – Em/F# – Em – Em/D
Melodic descending motion (bass-driven)
Cmaj7 – Bm7/D – D#dim
You took the words out of my mouth
Em – D – C – Bm – Am7 – D7

Notes:
- Rich harmonic layering in bridge; D#dim functions as pivot into Em
- Em descending line is voice-led and groove-preserving
- Builds tension and emotional texture with unexpected voicing shifts

[Final Refrains]
(Repeat earlier Refrain twice with full progression)
