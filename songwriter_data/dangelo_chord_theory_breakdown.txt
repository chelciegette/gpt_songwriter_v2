[Technique: Waterfall Bassline]
Used in: “Left and Right”
Chord Motion: Downward half-steps (e.g., G7 → Gbmaj7)
Effect: Smooth chromatic movement; connects unrelated chords with pleasing voice leading

[Technique: Sticky Top Note]
Used in: “Left and Right”
Definition: Top note of each voicing stays fixed while chords change below
Effect: Creates harmonic cohesion and continuity

[Song: “Send It On”]
Key: F Major
Chord Progression: Am7 – Gm11 – C13sus – Fmaj9
Technique Highlighted: Starts on the iii chord instead of I
→ This is called the “3-foot sub” (chord a third above or below tonic can sub in for tonic)
Explanation: Am7 shares key tones with Fmaj7 but creates a deeper, more modern vibe

[Technique: VX GAS]
Used in: “One Mo’Gin”
Explanation: VX = “V of X” (i.e., secondary dominant); GAS = just for the funky name
Example: F7 → not going to Bbmin, but instead to Dbmaj7 (subbing in as a 3rd away)
Effect: Extended dominant feel without expected resolution

[Song: “Feel Like Making Love” (cover)]
Key: B Major
Highlights:
- Starts on ii chord
- Uses B7 (V of E minor — “VX GAS”)
- E7 lingers → not transitional but part of emotional resolution

[Song: “Untitled (How Does It Feel)”]
Progression: Dmaj7 – Am7 – Gm7 – C7
Key Techniques:
- Smooth bass motion by skipping V chord
- Am7 → Gmaj7 is more fluid than Am7 → D7 → G
Lesson: Dominant 7th chords can interrupt neo-soul smoothness; avoid them for softer transitions

[Summary Notes]
- Dominant chords aren’t always needed (especially in neo-soul)
- Modal ambiguity and chromatic descent are hallmarks of the genre
- Voice leading matters as much as harmonic function
- R&B and gospel often intentionally skip traditional resolutions to preserve feel
