Title: Distance  
Artist: Emily King  
Genre: Neo-soul / Pop-R&B  
Key: C major  
Tempo: Mid-tempo / relaxed groove  
Time Signature: 4/4  

[Intro / Verse 1]  
Cmaj7 – Bm7 – Dm7  
Am7 – G  
Cmaj7 – Bm7 – Am7 – Bm7  
Cmaj7 – Bm7 – Dm7  
Am7 – G  
Cmaj7 – Bm7 – Am7 – D

Notes:
- Verse chord movement blends classic soul and jazz harmony
- Cmaj7 to Bm7 creates soft chromatic motion (I → vii)
- Dm7 and Am7 reinforce the tonal center while evoking a dreamy, conversational tone
- Movement like Am7 → G → Cmaj7 creates a gentle fall, giving the vocal room to lead
- Bm7 appears repeatedly as a pivot chord, adding introspective flavor

[Chorus]  
Gmaj7  
Gmaj7  
Cmaj7  
Cm7  
Gmaj7  
Cmaj7  
Cm7

Notes:
- Chorus opens with strong tonic (Gmaj7) and floats into colorful maj7/min7 chords
- The switch between Cmaj7 and Cm7 introduces **modal mixture** (major to minor), a signature soul-jazz move
- Emotional theme: distance feels warm but slightly unresolved
- Sparse harmonic rhythm lets lyrics carry the pulse

[Verse 2]  
(Same progression as the Chorus)  
Gmaj7  
Gmaj7  
Cmaj7  
Cm7  
Gmaj7  
Cmaj7  
Cm7

[Instrumental Tag]  
Gmaj7 – Gmaj7 – Cmaj7 – Cm7  
(repeats)

[Outro]  
Cmaj7 – Bm7 – Dm7  
Am7 – G  
Cmaj7 – Bm7 – Am7

Notes:
- Outro mirrors intro, reinforcing circular structure
- Harmonically it never fully “lands,” aligning with the theme of emotional space and longing
- Light chord shifts reflect relational tension between comfort and change
