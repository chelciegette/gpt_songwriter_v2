Dm7 – Em7 – F/G – C – E7

Notes:
- Opens in A minor with rich voice-leading: Am → E7/G# is a classic minor tonic to dominant motion
- C/G and D7/F# create slash-chord bass movement with strong emotional pull
- Use of Dm7–Em7 cycle adds movement while maintaining intimacy

Notes:
- Modulation and chromatic alterations like F#m7b5 and G6 add jazz flavor

- Melody stretches into upper vocal register, heightening intensity
- Emotional delivery supported by tension-and-release harmonic motion
