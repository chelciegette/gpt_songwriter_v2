Title: Sir Duke
Artist: Stevie Wonder
Genre: Funk / Soul / Jazz-Pop
Key: B Major
Tempo: Upbeat, celebratory
Time Signature: 4/4

[Intro]
B – G#m – G – F#
B – G#m – G – F#

Notes:
- Repeating chromatic descent in intro outlines a harmonic “hook”
- G and F# outside of B major scale add funk-influenced tension
- Sets a playful tone with surprise chromaticism

[Verse 1]
B – G#m – G9 – F#9
B – G#m – G9 – F#9 – F9
E9 – D#9 – D9 – C#9
D9 – D#9 – E9
E9 – D#9 – D9 – C#9
D9 – D#9 – E9 – F9 – F#9

Notes:
- Chromatic descending 9th chords (E9 to C#9) create strong forward motion
- Repeated use of G9, F#9, F9 blurs tonal center momentarily (modal borrowing)
- F#9 functions as dominant returning to tonic B major

[Chorus]
B – Fm7 – Emaj7 – C#m7 – F#7
B – Fm7 – Emaj7 – C#m7 – F#7

Notes:
- Chorus introduces Fm7 (chromatic subdominant) — unexpected and colorful
- Emaj7 and C#m7 add lyrical, jazzy warmth
- F#7 is strong V7 returning to tonic (B major), classic resolution

[Instrumental Break]
(Horn lines outline major and dominant arpeggios)
- Brass section plays rhythmic sixteenth-note figures
- Emphasizes B major scale tones with passing chromatic notes
- Call-and-response between horns and rhythm section

[Verse 2]
(Same progression as Verse 1)

[Chorus]
(Same as previous chorus)

[Outro]
(Repetition of chorus progression, possibly transposed or extended live)

Notes:
- Horn arrangement is central: syncopated, brassy, and melodic
- Harmonic rhythm is fast — multiple changes per measure
- Juxtaposes diatonic structure (B major) with chromatic surprises (G9, F9)
- Reflects Stevie Wonder’s jazz background and pop accessibility
