Title: You Know I'm No Good
Artist: Amy Winehouse
Genre: Jazz-Pop / Soul / Retro R&B
Key: D Minor
Tempo: ~103 BPM, swung groove
Time Signature: 4/4

[Verse 1]
Dm – Gm
Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
A7 – Dm
Your rolled up sleeves in your skull t-shirt
Dm – Gm
You say, “What did you do with him today?”
A7 – Dm
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray

[Pre-Chorus]
Gm
Cause you're my fella, my guy
E7
Hand me your stella and fly
F
By the time I'm out the door
E7 – A7
You tear men down like Roger Moore

[Chorus]
Dm – Am – E7 – Am
I cheated myself like I knew I would
Dm – Am – E7 – Am
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good

Notes:
- Dm is the minor tonic center with jazz-soul inflections
- E7 functions as V7/vi and as a pivot chord into Am
- Chromatic flavor through A7–Dm–Gm cycles
- Strong melodic interplay above a stable, looped progression

[Verse 2]
Dm – Gm
Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
A7 – Dm
He's in a place but I can't get joy
Dm – Gm
Thinking on you in the final throes
A7 – Dm
This is when my buzzer goes

[Pre-Chorus]
Gm
Run out to meet your chips and pitta
E7
You say, “When we're married,” 'cause you're not bitter
F
There'll be none of him no more
E7 – A7
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Dm – Gm
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
A7 – Dm
We're like how we were again
Dm – Gm
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
A7 – Dm
Lick your lips as I soak my feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Gm
Then you notice little carpet burn
E7
My stomach drops and my guts churn
F
You shrug and it's the worst
E7 – A7
Who truly stuck the knife in first

[Final Chorus]
Dm – Am – E7 – Am
I cheated myself like I knew I would
Dm – Am – E7 – Am
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good

(Repeat)

[Outro]
Dm

Notes:
- Repeating ii–V–i progression with chromatic and dominant substitutions
- Gm → E7 → A7 is non-diatonic yet maintains fluidity and forward motion
- Lyrics and harmony work in tandem to create a confessional, unresolved tone
- Chord loop matches Winehouse's lyrical vulnerability and retro-jazz vibe
