Title: Like a Star
Artist: Corinne Bailey Rae
Genre: Acoustic Soul / Singer-Songwriter
Key: A Minor (modal inflection and jazz influence)
Tempo: Slow, ~68 BPM

[Verse 1]
Dm7
Just like a star across my sky
E7
Just like an angel off the page
Am7
You have appeared to my life
D7
Feel like I'll never be the same
Dm7
Just like a song in my heart
Dm7b5
Just like oil on my hands
Am7 – Gm9
Honour to love you

Notes:
- Emotive jazz voicings like Dm7, Dm7b5, and Gm9 create warmth and space
- Minimal progression but highly expressive
- D7 is a secondary dominant that creates motion toward Gm9

[Hook]
C7 – Fmaj7
Still I wonder why it is
E7
I don't argue like this
Am – Gm7
With anyone but you
C7 – Fmaj7
We do it all the time
E7
Blowing out my mind

Notes:
- C7 to Fmaj7 gives a soulful, gospel-like resolution
- E7 acts as dominant back to Am
- Emotional arc peaks with subtle harmonic lift

[Verse 2]
Dm7
You've got this look I can't describe
E7
You make me feel like I'm alive
Am7
When everything else is au fait
D7
Without a doubt you're on my side
Dm7
Heaven has been away too long
E7
Can't find the words to write this song
Am7 – Gm9
Oh... Your love

[Repeat Hook]

C7 – Fmaj7
Still I wonder why it is
E7
I don't argue like this
Am – Gm7
With anyone but you
C7 – Fmaj7
We do it all the time
E7 – C#dim7
Blowing out my mind

[Verse 3]
Dm7
Now I have come to understand
E7
The way it is
Am7
It's not a secret anymore
D7
'Cause we've been through that before
Dm7 – E7
From tonight I know you're the only one
Am7 – D7
I've been confused and in the dark, now I understand

[Hook Fragment]
F7 – E7 – Am7 – Gm7

[Final Verse / Outro]
C7 – Fmaj7
I wonder why it is
E7
I don't argue like this
Am – Gm7
With anyone but you
C7 – Fmaj7
I wonder why it is
E7
I won’t let my guard down
Am – Abm7 – Gm7
For anyone but you
C7 – Fmaj7
We do it all the time
E7
Blowing out my mind

[Outro]
Dm7
Just like a star across my sky
E7
Just like an angel off the page

You have appeared to my life
D7
Feel like I'll never be the same
Dm7
Just like a song in my heart
Dm7b5
Just like oil on my hands
