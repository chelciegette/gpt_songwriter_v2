[Verse]
Gmaj7
I was not ready
Cmaj7
The day you gave me your heart
Cm7 – Gmaj7
I was still falling apart
Gmaj7
But since that moment
Cmaj7
I can't stop hearing your name
Cm7 – Gmaj7
Wondering about you always

Notes:
- Verse relies on Imaj7 (Gmaj7) and IVmaj7 (Cmaj7), creating a smooth, warm base
- Cm7 introduces modal mixture: a borrowed iv7 chord from G minor
- Emotional effect is intimate and unresolved

[Chorus] (x2)
Gmaj7
Come back Georgia, come back
F#7
Come back Georgia, come back
Am7
I just need another chance
Cm7
Chance to make it better

Notes:
- F#7 functions as V7 of Bm (implied tonic shift)
- Cm7 again used as chromatic surprise chord—gives sense of yearning
- Soulful turnaround built with smooth descending voice-leading

[Tag]
Am7 – Gmaj7
Oh to think that you would be
E7
Resting in my arms
Am7 – Cm7
Georgia where you are, I can't be without you
Abmaj7
Georgia oh

Notes:
- Modulation begins here: shift toward Ab major
- E7 used as pivot chord—bright dominant leading toward modulation
- Abmaj7 confirms key change and lifts emotion subtly

[Chorus 2] (in Ab major)
Abmaj7
Come back Georgia, come back
G7
Come back Georgia, come back
Bbm7
I just need another chance
Dbm7
Chance to make it better

Notes:
- Full modulation to Ab major established
- G7 borrowed as a secondary dominant to transition
- Dbm7 is non-diatonic—serves as emotionally rich iv7 chord in new key
